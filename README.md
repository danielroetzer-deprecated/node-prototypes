# node-prototypes
Testing different node.js functions and modules in several prototypes


## Short description of each prototype
- **HelloWorld** - Displaying a simple "Hello World!" message in the browser.
- **Modules** - Testing the module export method to create own modules and understand the usability behind this system.
- **Morgan** - Logging module for http actions.
- **Winston** - Making use of the multi-transport async logging library for general logging information and critical things like errors.
- **BodyParser** - Converts html data from a formular to JavaScript objects, so we can work with the data on the server.
- **Pug** - Pug allows us to send data from the server to the .pug file, which is then converted to html. Without it, we could not use variables inside of html files.
- **RethinkDB** - Establishing a connection to the database called "RethinkDB" and inserting simple data values.
- **Final** - Combines all previous prototypes in a final one.
